--execute every time you die i just got this from the old code that was made like a year ago not verified to work but it should 
local player = game.Players.LocalPlayer
local character = player.Character or player.CharacterAdded:Wait()
local team = character.Parent:GetChildren() 

local weaponSizes = {
    Sword = Vector3.new(7, 1.5, 1.5),
    Spear = Vector3.new(25, 1.5, 1.5),
    Javelin = Vector3.new(10, 1.5, 1.5),
    Longsword = Vector3.new(7, 2, 2),
    Polearm = Vector3.new(20, 1.5, 1.5)
}


local function adjustWeaponSize(weapon, weaponType)
    local newSize = weaponSizes[weaponType]
    if newSize then
        if weaponType == "Polearm" and weapon.Name == "Sapper Axe" then
            weapon.Blade.Size = Vector3.new(10, 2, 2)
        else
            weapon.Blade.Size = newSize
        end
    end
end


for _, item in ipairs(character:GetChildren()) do
    if item:IsA("Model") and item:FindFirstChild("Blade") then
        local weaponType = item:GetAttribute("WeaponType")
        if weaponType and weaponSizes[weaponType] then
            adjustWeaponSize(item, weaponType)
            item:SetAttribute("Reach", 100)  
        end
    end
end


for _, teammate in ipairs(team) do
    if teammate ~= character then
        local colliders = teammate:GetChildren()
        for _, collider in ipairs(colliders) do
            if collider.Name == "PlayerCollider" then
                collider:Destroy()
            end
        end
    end
end
